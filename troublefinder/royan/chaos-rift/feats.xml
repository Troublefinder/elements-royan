			<p>Thanks to extensive practice with the Titascium Firearm, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You ignore the loading quality of Titascium Firearms with which you are proficient.</li>
				<li>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.</li>
				<li>When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a Titascium Pistol you are holding.</li>
