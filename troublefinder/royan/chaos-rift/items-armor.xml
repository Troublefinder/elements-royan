		<description>
			<p>This suit of armor is reinforced with a magically enhanced metal alloy called duerinium, which is made in Duergar foundries deep in the under rifts. While you're wearing the armor, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. In addition, when you are subjected to a magical effect that allows you to make a Strength or Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.</p>

Both trees must be Large or bigger. Giant fungi are also classified as a tree for this purpose.</p>

The wood of a spear, club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature’s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already. This ability lasts for 1 minute and can be used 3 times per day.</p>
